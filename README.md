# LibCSP-rs

A safe LibCSP wrapper for Rust.

Currently, this wrapper is planned to support only the features necessary for the Toliman mission.

## Compiling

For the project to compile, the relevant headers need to be installed in the system, as well as the dynamic library compiled with the features that are enabled in this crate.

For reference, use `shell.nix`.
